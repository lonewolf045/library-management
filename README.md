My goal is to make a library management system, if you don't see that, it means project is still under development and what you are using is a beta version of the application. As of 17th June 12:00 AM, I have added features from my other project library plus made it individual user driven project, i.e. you can signup/login into your account to view your books. I have added an update book feature ,update password feature and an update profile feature. I am planning on adding an update user information feature, which can be accessed from a side panel along with other tools like adding book, logging out etc. which are now scattered across your page.Also, my aim for the future is to add fields which indicate the book status right now i.e whether you own it or you have borrowed it from someone.

If you want to know how a collective library page is, then visit, https://personal-library.firebaseapp.com/ or https://lonewolf045.github.io/library/index.html

Note- If you want to signup into the account, please choose a password which is not used by you regularly, beacuse every data you enter is visible to me. Rememeber, "Big Brother is watching you".

If you want to contact me, then try but you won't be able to.
